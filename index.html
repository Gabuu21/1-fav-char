                <h1><b><center>Jean Gunnhildr</center></b></h1>
                <p><b>Jean Gunnhildr</b> is a playable Anemo character in Genshin Impact.</p>

                <p>As the acting Grand Master for the Knights, Jean takes all of her responsibilities and duties associated with the role seriously, regardless of how minor the tasks may seem, such as finding a lost cat. Due to this, Jean often exhausts herself trying to complete commissions from the locals, much to the concern of her fellow members.</p>

                <p>Her devotion to her duties stems from two reasons; her upbringing as a child, and Varka's teachings. Even though he consistently takes his duties lightly, his relaxed and unruly personality has contributed to her growth. She shows no resentment towards his attitude, instead vowing to ensure that the city will be more prosperous and welcoming when he returns. Her work ethic makes her well-liked by both Mondstadt's citizens, her fellow members, and is noted by other organizations. Although she prefers using peaceful methods to solve problems, she will not hesitate to use force if necessary. She has a habit of calling Diluc her senior, even well after he left the Knights. Despite this, she acknowledges that they both share the same vision of protecting Mondstadt.</p>
                    
                <p>She sees Vennessa as a role model because of her exploits and how she left an impressive legacy behind and works tirelessly to maintain her legacy and Mondstadt's safety. Whenever she feels troubled or confused, she often heads to the Great Tree in Windrise.</p>

            <div class="w3-container w3-animate-left w3-half" style="text-align: justify;">
                <p>The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of the city.

                <p>In addition to keeping the city and the surrounding travel routes safe from the threat of wild monsters, the Knights' most important responsibility is maintaining order among Mondstadt's inhabitants.

                <p>Mondstadt is the City of Freedom, but unchecked freedom without any kind of rules only invites chaos and anxiety.

                <p>Jean's understanding of this is the reason she remains diligent at all times, holding herself to impeccable standards.

                <p>However, she often finds that she exhausts her monthly quota of coffee within the first few days of the month as a result.

                <p>Nilou is extremely polite to just about everyone she

                skilled in dancing, being the main star of the Zubayr 
                Theater. She is patient and helpful, guiding people 
                through issues they have step-by-step and offering ways 
                to relieve stress.

                <p>She enjoys sweets, seeing them as a way to make people 
                happy. On the other hand, she despises mushrooms; she has 
                trauma after eating a poisonous mushroom and is unable to 
                discern the differences between poisonous and non-
                poisonous mushrooms.

                <p>"Since you're in Sumeru, you must not miss Nilou's performances."</p>
                <p>This is a fact that most people in Sumeru agree on. There is no threshold for Nilou's dances, so everyone can come and enjoy a most fascinating and engrossing time there. Nilou's audience comes from all walks of life. Be it a knowledgeable researcher or a mercenary who's seen true brutality — everyone is attracted here by Nilou's gorgeous, dancing form. Every time Nilou takes the stage, a press of people crowds the Grand Bazaar until all are standing shoulder to shoulder. Rational sense and wisdom are the mainstream in Sumeru, while art, which stands for sensibility, does not enjoy the same popularity and respect. Yet if wisdom is meaning bestowed upon Sumeru by the goddess, then art stands for meaning that human beings seek for themselves.</p>

                <h1 class="w3-center"><b>Raiden Shogun</b></h1>
                <p>The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.

<p>The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms — Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to oversee Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation. The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant and carries out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards anything other than "eternity", the puppet is able to be manipulated by external influences. For example, the Kujou Clan and Fatui persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.

<p>While Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and passion of martial arts. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei maintains a wary attitude on the idea of change. However, she demonstrates curiosity rather than disdain towards new affairs, such as the appearance of the Traveler and the customs of the modern world. Due to having lost many of her loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss wanting to preserve Inazuma. To this end, she previously sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion. She created the puppet Shogun to ensure immunity from the decay of her physical body. While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to it resulting in loss and suffering. Thus, making it incompatible with eternity. While in the Plane of Euthymia she was not unmoved by loneliness, as Ei is shown enjoying Yae Miko and the Traveler's company.

<p>In spite of her flawed actions, Ei is devoted to Inazuma, simply longing to protect it and her people. After she is convinced that her actions were destructive, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her perspective regarding eternity to become a better ruler. She also gained a newfound respect for the idea of human ambition and it's achievements.</p>

                <p>After purging all sentiment with merciless lightning, the solitude of her mind became a secluded space free from mortal joys and woes...

                <p>Over the long years, the road to eternity has been dark and desolate, but Her Excellency the Shogun has never wavered, not even for a moment.

                <p>For true unchanging eternity is found only in the stillness that manifests itself when all noise is stripped away.</p>

                <p>The Traveler is the playable protagonist of Genshin Impact. In the opening cutscene, twin siblings from another world travel through the universe, until an unknown god blocks their path. The player gets to choose either Aether (male) or Lumine (female) as the traveler and Traveler's Sibling gets captured. Their power to travel is sealed, leaving them stranded on Teyvat.

<p>During their fight with the Unknown God, both siblings had glowing white clothing and yellow wings. After, the player's chosen sibling will lose their white light — Aether's will turn a glassy black and Lumine's will be dull, but these pieces will light up once again after resonating with a Statue of the Seven. The color will change based on which element they are resonated with.

<p>Their outfit, Rising Star, is described to be a practical set of clothing to wear during a long journey.</p>
<p>Lumine has pale blonde hair. Her hair is cut in a short and choppy bob with two longer shoulder-length locks of hair framing her face, with two light-blue Inteyvat flowers pinned to the right of her head and two pale blue feathers tucked at the left.

<p>Her color scheme consists of white, light blue, and gold. She wears a sleeveless, backless, box pleated white dress held up by crossed black straps. She wears a long two-tailed scarf, with each tail having a gold, flat diamond-shaped ornament attached to the tip of the tail. Her legwear consists of angled thigh-high stockings and white ankle-high boots.</p>

<p>Various celebrations held in Inazuma City every year all have elaborate firework displays created by Yoimiya. She possesses an exuberant creativity and passion for firework displays that always leave people pleasantly surprised.

<p>Yoimiya has a childlike innocence, and is often found playing simple yet timeless games with children or accompanying them to find shiny trinkets and toys. The purity of children brings her unparalleled joy.

<p>She also enjoys social interaction and seizes every opportunity to talk to others. She appears to have endless anecdotes and ideas to be shared.

<p>Both a moment and an eternity, these fleeting marvels are an expression of "protection" she gives to those around her.

Having very few worries of her own, she can also read peoples' hearts and can tell whether or not they're hiding something deep down.

<p>Like her father, Yoimiya is devoted to the family business, stating that her customers' happiness is the first priority above all else. This service has amassed a massive and loyal customer base who are willing to help her out on any problems she have. She is somewhat of a fast speaker, and despite being the primary provider of fireworks, is also known to be quite reckless and unprepared, having been scolded by the city's fire brigade numerous times and noted by Amenoma Tougo to always make last-minute preparations.

<p>Like many other Vision bearers, Yoimiya enjoys her Pyro Vision, as it helps her out with the business and she couldn't imagine a life without one. While not supportive of the Vision Hunt Decree, she still worships Ei.</p>

                <h1><b>HELLO TRAVELERS</b></h1>
                <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches using the games as a service model.

                <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.</p>
